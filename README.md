# hello-world
My first steps on github, so I can hopefully understand my fellow geek friends a little bit better

Hi, 

My name is David, I have coded a bit like 30 years ago (Visual Basic, Turbo Pascal and some freaky shit on my Commodore 64) but never ever since then. My profession is business development (sales, marketing, accountmanagement). Since I am working with a bunch of geeks at a great IT company in the Netherlands called SpronQ, I wanted to understand a bit more about this 'new digital world'.

See ya!
David Zeman
