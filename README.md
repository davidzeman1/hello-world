# hello-world
My first steps on github, so I can hopefully understand my fellow geek friends a bit better

Hi, 

My name is David, made in the Czech Republic and born in the Netherlands (1969). I have coded a bit like 30 years ago (VB, Turbo Pascal and some freaky shit on my Commodore 64) but never ever since then. My passion is business development (sales, marketing, accountmanagement). Since I am working with a bunch of geeks at a great IT company in the Netherlands called SpronQ, I wanted to understand a bit more about this 'new digital world'.

See ya!

PS: Since this is only some simple stupid text lines, the next phase should be to add some crazy JS code to it, but I think I need help from other to do that. Any ideas?
